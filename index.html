          Inspiration for our apparels - A collection for desi Dora, jodhpur. We
          wanted to design a collection that gave comfort to the wearer demand
          at any moment. The idea of anti-fit clothing is at its peak as it
          represents the society that talks about freedom and breaking barrier
          and also makes the wearer stronger. The silhouettes are mostly relaxed
          and oversized, designed to keep in mind the overall aesthetic of the
          brand ( a door to the modern and cultural style of India). We kept the
          fabrics very light woven and tunics designed with pockets. The
          leftover fabric scraps were converted into small potlis to make sure
          that no fabric is wasted.

          Our clay jewellery - Two individuals with a passion for creativity --
          creativity makes us happy. Started with a dream to embrace things that
          are made by hand in small quantities. A range of handcrafted clay
          earrings where each piece is one-of-a-kind and handmade from start to
          finish and infused with love, energy and handwork into each piece of
          work. Each earring has a unique story to tell. The bold shapes and
          colours are used to make you feel even stronger. We aim to keep Indian
          craftsmanship alive and also help artisans especially women artisans
          earn their livelihood. The earrings are developed using clay, which
          makes it lightweight and it doesnâ€™t break.
